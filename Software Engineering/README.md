## Docker:

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker's methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

## Kubernetes:

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.

## Alembic:

Alembic provides for the creation, management, and invocation of change management scripts for a relational database, using SQLAlchemy as the underlying engine.

## Swagger UI:

Swagger UI allows anyone — be it your development team or your end consumers — to visualize and interact with the API’s resources without having any of the implementation logic in place. It’s automatically generated from your OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) Specification, with the visual documentation making it easy for back end implementation and client side consumption.

## FastAPI:
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to be fast and easy to use, providing automatic validation, serialization, and interactive API documentation. FastAPI is commonly used for building RESTful APIs and microservices.

## SQLAlchemy:
SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL. It provides a full suite of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple and Pythonic domain language.

## FastAPI with SQLAlchemy:
FastAPI doesn't require you to use a SQL (relational) database. But you can use any database that you want. As SQLModel is based on SQLAlchemy, you can easily use any database supported by SQLAlchemy (which makes them also supported by SQLModel), like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, etc.
